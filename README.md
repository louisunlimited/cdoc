# cdoc

A very tiny cli tool that helps me spin up empty latex homework templates to write homeworks on.

## TODO

(These are in no particular order)

- [ ] Move away from string literals to a template file
- [ ] Add a way to specify the output directory
- [ ] Make it be able to read configuation from ~/.cdocrc
- [ ] Automate CI/CD
